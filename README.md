# AvalonWorldFiles

World-building files and documentation for the Avalon book project.

## Directory Structure

This repository is organized to help you develop and track all aspects of your world:

- **Characters/** - Character profiles, bios, and development notes
- **Locations/** - Places, cities, regions, and geographic information
- **History/** - Timeline, historical events, and world lore
- **MagicAndSystems/** - Magic systems, technology, and other world mechanics
- **Cultures/** - Societies, factions, customs, and cultural details
- **Plot/** - Story arcs, plot points, scenes, and narrative structure

## How to Use

Each directory contains a README.md template to help you organize your content. You can:

1. Create new markdown files for individual elements (e.g., `Characters/protagonist.md`)
2. Use the templates as a starting point for documenting your world
3. Cross-reference between files using relative links
4. Track changes through git to see how your world evolves

## Getting Started

1. Choose a directory that matches what you want to develop
2. Review the README.md template in that directory
3. Create a new file or copy the template for your specific content
4. Start building your world!

## Tips

- Keep files focused on single elements (one character per file, one location per file, etc.)
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `character-name.md`)
- Link related content (e.g., link a character to their hometown in Locations/)
- Commit frequently to track your creative progress
